👋 Hi, I’m Jesús Marcano. I hold a BA in Economics ([Universidad Central de Venezuela, UCV](http://www.ucv.ve/)) and I'm finishing up a
Master of Public Management ([Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Administración, IESA](http://www.iesa.edu.ve/)).

👀 I’m interested in Policy Learning, Public Finance, Labor Market, Crime, Policy Analysis, Impact Evaluation, Causal Inference and 
Econometrics.

🌱 I’m currently learning the implementation of experimental and quasi-experimental research designs in R and STATA, the use of text
editors (i.e., Atom, Emacs, Vim) in my daily work, the content and empirical evaluation of current policy learning theories and the
details of causal inference.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the development of code for causal inference and the research of policy learning.
