👋 Hi, I’m Jesús Marcano. I hold a BA in Economics ([Universidad Central de Venezuela, UCV](http://www.ucv.ve/)) and I'm finishing up a
Master of Public Management ([Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Administración, IESA](http://www.iesa.edu.ve/)).

👀 I’m interested in Policy Learning, Public Finance and Impact Evaluation.

🌱 I’m currently learning about the principles and recent contributions on causal inference, the theories and empirical evidence on
policy learning and the implementation of experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation in R and STATA.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the development of code for causal inference.
