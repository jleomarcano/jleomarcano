👋 Hi, I’m Jesús Marcano. I hold a BA in Economics ([Universidad Central de Venezuela, UCV](http://www.ucv.ve/)) and I'm finishing up a
Master of Public Management ([Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Administración, IESA](http://www.iesa.edu.ve/)).

👀 I’m interested in impact evaluation, policy learning and political economy.

🌱 I’m currently learning foundations of causal inference, estimators for quasi-experimental research, leading practices in coding for data analysis, policy learning theories and political economy theories.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing code for causal inference and impact evaluation.
