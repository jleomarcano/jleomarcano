👋 Hi, I am Jesús Marcano. I hold a BA in Economics ([Universidad Central de Venezuela, UCV](http://www.ucv.ve/)) and a
Master of Public Management ([Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Administración, IESA](http://www.iesa.edu.ve/)). 

👀 I am interested in data analysis, statistics and machine learning, with a focus on building solutions and creating knowledge to solve the most important issues in our world.

🌱 I am constantly learning about the latest methods or frameworks that may be used to tackle problems in which data analysis and modelling are needed.

💞️ I am looking to collaborate on developing code to analyze and model data that might be useful to improve the world.
