👋 Hi, I’m Jesús Marcano. I hold a BA in Economics ([Universidad Central de Venezuela, UCV](http://www.ucv.ve/)) and I'm finishing up a
Master of Public Management ([Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Administración, IESA](http://www.iesa.edu.ve/)).

👀 I’m interested in impact evaluation, international development, political economy, governance and policy learning.

🌱 I’m currently learning about causal inference; experimental and quasi-experimental research designs; leading practices in coding for data analysis; international development sub-fields; and the political economy of public financial management.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing code for causal inference and impact evaluation.
