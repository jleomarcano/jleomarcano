👋 Hi, I am Jesús Marcano. I hold a BA in Economics ([Universidad Central de Venezuela, UCV](http://www.ucv.ve/)) and a
Master of Public Management ([Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Administración, IESA](http://www.iesa.edu.ve/)).

👀 I am interested in public policy and international development.

🌱 I am continuously learning about the most innovative and effective policies that can be implemented to tackle the most pressing international development issues. In addition, I am constantly learning about the latest and most useful research methods that may be applied to conduct research at the intersection of public policy and international development.

💞️ I am looking to collaborate on developing code for causal and descriptive data analysis.
